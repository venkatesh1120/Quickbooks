# Quickbooks
This contains a basic User Interface to get authenticated with quickbook and to store the required token i have used an ibject called integration.
we can also make it a single sign on by using refresh token. I have also done.
make a callout  using schedulable class every 1hour using refreshtoken to renew the acces token.
i have can uses a scheduled class to do a two way synchronization between quickbooks.
i have also created a object that would create created checks in quickbooks to salesforce and a batch class to make get updated status of checks with help of scheduled and get methods.
You can use batch post to genetated greater than 1500 checks that what i haved test but the realtime value should around 3000.
the prcoess would be similar to other object(QBO) of aswell
